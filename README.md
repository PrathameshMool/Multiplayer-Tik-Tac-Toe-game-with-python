# Multiplayer-Tik-Tac-Toe-game-with-python

Tic tac toe is a classic two-player paper-and-pencil game, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid. The game ends in a draw if all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won.

This project involves creating a digital version of the tic tac toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game should have a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to make their moves by clicking on the appropriate squares on the grid. The game should also display whose turn it is, and announce the winner or draw at the end of the game.

Features:

* 3x3 grid displayed on the screen using Tkinter widgets
* Ability for players to make moves by clicking on the appropriate squares on the grid
* Display whose turn it is (either X or O) using a Tkinter label widget
* Announce the winner or draw at the end of the game using a Tkinter label widget
* Reset button to start a new game using a Tkinter button widget

The game keeps track of whose turn it is and announces the winner or draw at the end of the game. The code also includes a "play again" button that resets the game and allows the players to start a new game. The game logic is implemented in the XOPoint and WinningPossibility classes, which handle the logic for setting a point and checking if a player has won, respectively.
